        Hello, I'm Jack Bradley, and I am the founder and creator of TeeTag.com.
        I'm a 19-year-old sophomore at the University of Iowa. This project
        holds a special place in my heart and means the world to me due to the
        past of losing my amazing mother to esophageal cancer about 5 years ago.
        I created TeeTag in memory of my mom (Margo Bradley) but to also raise
        money for teenagers who’ve also lost a parent to cancer. I understand
        firsthand how incredibly hard it is both emotionally and financially. I
        love working on TeeTag (it's my baby) and I am excited to see where I
        can take it and how many kids I can help along the way.

                My Mom was one of these people who would always see the bright
                side in every situation. She was positive, funny, and most
                importantly – selfless. I don’t know how she did it – helping
                with all the sports and activities my sister and I were involved
                it, Physical Therapy and help for my special needs brother,
                going all out for the countless parties held within my family…
                the list is endless. She was indeed the best Mommy ever.

            In August of 2017 (13 years old), my beautiful and amazing mother
            sat me down at her bedside to inform me that she had been diagnosed
            with Stage 4 Esophagus Cancer. She was my backbone; she was
            everything. All the prayers, sleepless nights by her side, and
            endless hugs weren’t enough to heal her. In February of 2018, she
            gracefully passed away.

            Losing her at such a young age rocked my world, and still to this
            day, not a day goes by when I don't think about her. I miss her. But

            I understand how hard it can be to lose a parent, and I think we
            also understand how many lives cancer touches. But I hope to shine a
            light through the dark storm of loss. And help put a bandage on a
            giant wound. Specifically, helping kids who’ve lost a parent to
            cancer and helping fund their future education. I chose this
            demographic because it is personal to me and also understand how
            expensive school can be. Additionally, I am trying to pay for my own
            college expenses and hopefully my 17-year-old sister Janes’ too.

            TeeTag is meant to be a fun, interactive game through the use of
            t-shirts to help raise money for children who’ve lost a parent to
            cancer. I am excited to hopefully unlock TeeTag’s potential and make
            a lasting difference. Thank you for listening to my story - it means
            the world.
